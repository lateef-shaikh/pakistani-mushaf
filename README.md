# Quran mushaf in Pakistani/Indian sub continent style in HTML5

## Proof Read status
This mushaf is still **not proof read**. Please use is cautiously.

## Some background
Unicode now has all Pakistani/Indian sub continent marks (ramooz-e-auqaf) incorporated. But unfortunately none of the Quran text available online uses those marks and instead every website uses their own font and text where a non-standard code point is used for those marks. Another issue is that Unicode also has End Of Aaya mark but again no Quranic text is using it also.

Font development is my hobby and I only make Arabic Script based OpenType fonts. Together with the help of some friends, who are in Quran publishing industry in Pakistan and who also felt same issues which I described above, I created proposal to Unicode for these marks to be included. Alhamdulillah a modified version of the proposal got approved which had all main marks which were needed.

After this step, I updated my fonts ([PakType fonts](http://paktype.sourceforge.net/)) and started working on this mushaf. I got the initial text from https://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp02/%d8%ae%d8%b7-%d9%86%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%8a%d9%82 therefore I a little bit confident that it'll have less mistakes.
